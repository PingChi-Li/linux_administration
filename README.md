# Project: Linux Server Administration

This repository shares technical knowledge about Linux server administration based on Unix philosophy.

## Unix Philosophy Principles

1. **Make each program do one thing well**:
   - To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new "features".

2. **Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program**:
   - Don't clutter output with extraneous information.
   - Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats.
   - Don't insist on interactive input.

3. **Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks**:
   - Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.

4. **Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task**:
   - Even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you've finished using them.
